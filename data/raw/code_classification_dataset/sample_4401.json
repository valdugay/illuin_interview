    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case, Phoenix puts the gold piece with weight $$$3$$$ on the scale first, then the piece with weight $$$2$$$, and finally the piece with weight $$$1$$$. The total weight on the scale is $$$3$$$, then $$$5$$$, then $$$6$$$. The scale does not explode because the total weight on the scale is never $$$2$$$.In the second test case, the total weight on the scale is $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, $$$11$$$, $$$14$$$, then $$$18$$$. It is never $$$3$$$.In the third test case, Phoenix must put the gold piece with weight $$$5$$$ on the scale, and the scale will always explode.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Phoenix has collected $$$n$$$ pieces of gold, and he wants to weigh them together so he can feel rich. The $$$i$$$-th piece of gold has weight $$$w_i$$$. All weights are distinct. He will put his $$$n$$$ pieces of gold on a weight scale, one piece at a time. The scale has an unusual defect: if the total weight on it is exactly $$$x$$$, it will explode. Can he put all $$$n$$$ gold pieces onto the scale in some order, without the scale exploding during the process? If so, help him find some possible order. Formally, rearrange the array $$$w$$$ so that for each $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\le i \\le n)$$$, $$$\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{i}w_j \\ne x$$$.",

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of gold pieces that Phoenix has and the weight to avoid, respectively.  The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$(1 \\le w_i \\le 100)$$$ — the weights of the gold pieces. It is guaranteed that the weights are pairwise distinct.",
